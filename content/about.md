My name is Zihao Zhang, pronounced as *zee-how*. I am currently a 3rd year (junior?) computer science student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Before university, my main area of interests were [competitive programming](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/5050), [game development](https://github.com/zzh8829/PythonCraft) and computer security. Since then, I have transitioned into machine learning, artificial intelligence and neuroscience research, and a bit of [web dev](https://zihao.me) on the side. Every other term, I will try to find an internship for some sweat $$$. I have worked at [Square](https://squareup.com), [Yahoo!](https://yahoo.com) and [Yelp](https://yelp.com) so far.

The articles here are mostly a memo for myself, so don't expect the quality to be very high. Yes, I know my writing skill sucks and tutorials are way too simplified. But having something shitty is infinitely better than having nothing at all. You are welcomed to leave a comment or send me emails for questions.

If you would like to contact for anything, send email to [zzh8829@gmail](mailto:zzh8829@gmail.com). If email is too old for you DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zzh8829), [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/zzh8829) or [Facebook](https://facebook.com/zihao.pro.zhang)
