My name is [Zihao Zhang](/resume.pdf), pronounced as *zee-how*. I am currently a 4th year computer science student at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Before university, my main area of interests were [competitive programming](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/people/5050), [game development](https://github.com/zzh8829/PythonCraft) and computer security. Since then, I have transitioned into machine learning, artificial intelligence and neuroscience research, and a bit of [web dev](https://zihao.me) on the side. Every other term, I will try to find an internship for some sweet $$$. I have worked at [Square](https://squareup.com), [Yahoo!](https://yahoo.com), [Yelp](https://yelp.com), [Google](https://google.com) so far.

During spring 2018, I am working at [Embark](https://embarktrucks.com/) developing autonomous vehicles.
