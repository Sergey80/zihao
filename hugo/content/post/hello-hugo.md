I always wanted to start a legitimate blog but never had the determination. There are so many fun projects that I wanted to share. This may finally be the place to begin.

```python
def hello():
  print 'Hello World!'
```

Before starting this, I tried out some different platforms including wordpress, jekyll and many more, Hugo seems to be the winner for me.

#### Wordpress
Self-hosting wordpress takes way too much work. Hosted solution are still complicated, on top of that I'm not a big fan of PHP. However, I do have a [wordpress site](https://usacosolutions.wordpress.com/) with my solutions to some USACO training problems back when I was still in high school.

#### Blogger
Is this still relvent in 2017? Blogger is one of those Google products that was once popular but became forgotten as Google stopped maintaining it.

#### [Logdown](https://logdown.com/)
Logdown is a simple to use hosted markdown blog. I really like their user experience but unfortunately custom domain is a paid premium feature

#### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
Nothing wrong with it really, no complains from my limited experience with Jekyll.

#### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
The chosen one! Lighting fast static blog generator with tons of customizations. Can be hosted on GitHub/GitLab pages for free with custom domain. Also Hugo seems to be more popular than other generators.

Anyways, that concludes my extremely biased thinking on blogging platforms :P

Welcome all readers :)
